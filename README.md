# University Management System

This is my **final project** for the **Basic Java Class** in the QC Studio.
The goal is to create a small console application where I apply the most important concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.

## Project Description

The system simulates a small **university**, where we can manage:

* **Teachers**

  * Full-time teachers (salary depends on years of experience).
  * Part-time teachers (salary depends on active hours per week).

* **Students**

  * Each student has a name, ID, and age.

* **University Classes**

  * Each class has a name, a classroom, one teacher, and a list of students.

## Features

When the program starts, it automatically creates:

* 2 full-time teachers and 2 part-time teachers.
* 6 students.
* 4 university classes (with teacher and students included).

Then the user can interact with a **menu** that allows:

1. List all teachers with their data.
2. List all classes, and select one to see its details (teacher and students).
3. Create a new student and add it to an existing class.
4. Create a new class and assign an existing teacher and existing students.
5. Search for the classes in which a student is enrolled (by ID).
6. Exit the program.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/university-management-system.git
   ```

2. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA** (or any IDE).

3. Run the `Main` class.

4. Use the menu to explore the system.
